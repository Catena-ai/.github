# 🌐 Catena.ai – Run, Share, and Remix AI Agents Instantly 🚀

Welcome to **Catena.ai** – a platform to upload, share, download, and run AI agents with a click of a button. Imagine it as the **"social media platform for AI agents"**, but with drag-and-drop workflows and a social overlay to make collaboration seamless.

## 👁️ Vision

AI agents are now scattered across repos, notebooks, and blogs. Executing one normally takes: cloning a repo, installing dependencies, hunting for absent API keys, and debugging. Catena.ai removes that friction by making it possible for anyone to:

* **Upload** an agent in a portable format (WebAssembly containerized, or pre-bundled).
* **Download & Import** agents into a sandbox on your local machine.
* **Drag & Drop** multiple agents together into an interactive workflow playground.
* **Run Immediately** with no setup – just end-users provide their own local API keys.
*

## 🛠️ Platform Architecture (MVP)

* **Local-First Runtime** – agents run within isolated containers/WebAssembly modules on the user device for security.
* **Agent Bundling** – dependencies are pre-bundled.
* **Key Vault** – users store their own API keys locally in an encrypted vault; agents only load them at runtime.
* **Frontend Social Layer** – social hub where you search, star, comment, and share agents.
* **Playground** – graph workflow editor where you drag in agents, connect them up, and click Run.

Future plans are for **cloud-hosted runtime** for always-on agents and subscription-based scaling.

## 🔑 Why This Matters

* **For Developers** – goodbye 40-step READMEs. Publish your agent in one click.
* **For Non-Technical Users** – play and run agents hassle-free from dependencies.
* **For Teams** – remix workflows by combining agents into high-powered flows.
